# Comments
This is my first time on GitHub since me and my last company always used Visual Studio Team Foundations for verison control, as it provides better integration with Visual Studio. I could have done it there itself but it doesnt support public repos as far as free version is concerned.
# Known Issues
1.currently the characters dont have any animations
2. The bombs stack on each other. They dont check if there was a previous bomb already.
3. If player doesnt move immediatly after placing bomb they might get thrown.
